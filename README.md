#  Active Directory

## Objective
The goal of this project was to build a controlled lab environment to simulate cyber attacks and analyze them using a SIEM system. This hands-on experience was designed to improve practical cybersecurity skills, including threat detection, log analysis, and Active Directory administration.

## Skills Developed
- Proficient use of SIEM tools for log ingestion and threat detection
- Strong understanding of Active Directory, DNS, and Group Policy management
- Generated attack telemetry to identify common attack patterns
- Deepened knowledge of network traffic, protocols, and vulnerabilities

##  Tools Used
- Windows Server (Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, Group Policy)
- Splunk was used for real-time monitoring of security and threat detection while gathering my virtual machines' data
- PowerShell and scripting utilities for configuration
- AtomicRedTeam was used to simulate and test attacks on my target machine with the help of Splunk
- Kali Linux was used as the attacking machine
- Hydra was used to brute force an Active Directory user I created
